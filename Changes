VERSION 1.0:

  Released 1.0 on April 27, 2002.

  Provided a fix for cases when we try remove the domain name from the
  display even if it is actually an IP address.

  Fixed a ton of formatting bugs and "use of uninitialized value"
  errors.

  Adjusted column widths and headinds a bit to fit the common cases
  that I usually see.

  Added "Now/Sec" to the header, next to "Avg/Sec".  The former is the
  "real-time" queries per second since the last mytop refresh, while
  the later is the queries per second since the server was last reset.

  Added the `o' key to toggle the sort order.

  Changed the `h' key to `H' for toggling the header.

  Added the `h' key to filter based on hostname.

  Changed the "Query Info" colum to "Query or State" because if there
  is no query running (like when a slave is replicating off the master
  and you're watching the master), it'll show the state in that
  column.

  The real-time queries/sec are computed using Time::HiRes if it is
  available, making the numbers much more accurate.

  Added the `e' key to EXPLAIN a query.  It works a lot like the `f'
  key to get the full SQL of a query.  Also, if you're already looking
  at the full SQL (having pressed `f'), you can hit `e' to get it
  explained if you'd like.

  That's all.

VERSION 0.9:

  Set $0 to `mytop' to make it easier to spot and to keep some of the
  command-line args out of view.

  Remembered to include the README in the distribution.

VERSION 0.8:

  Added a "Queries Per Second" or qps mode. You can enter qps mode by
  hitting the `m' key. In this mode, mytop will write out one integer
  per second. The number written reflects the number of queries
  executed by the server in the previous one second interval.

  mytop is now distributed as a true Perl package. There's a normal
  Makefile.PL, which means it can be installed via the standard
  mantra:

    perl Makefile.PL
    make
    make test
    make install

  This should make life a bit easier. It also means that you could
  install it using the CPAN shell.

VERSION 0.7:

  Basic support for Windows. The screen clearing doesn't work (not
  sure how to do that). But most everything else seems to be
  functional there.

VERSION 0.6:

  Some minor code cleanup.

VERSION 0.5:

  Fixed some field widths to handle larger values.

VERSION 0.4:

  Added -P command-line argument (to specify a port number).

  Fixes to make mytop output better on small terminals.

  Added `i' hotkey to toggle the display of Idle (sleeping) threads.

  Other minor updates.

VERSION 0.3:

  Updated documentation to reflect command-line arguments.

  Added support for long and short command-line arguments.

  Optional color support via Term::ANSIColor.

  Added batch mode. In batch mode, mytop doesn't clear the screen and
  only outputs data once. It's useful for running periodically and
  capturing the data to a file. In batch mode, there is no limit to
  the number of threads listed.

  Fixed division by zero bug in key cache code.

  Implemented the `r' keystroke to reset the status counters via a
  FLUSH STATUS call.

  If you resize your xterm, mytop now adapts somewhat well.

  Implemented the `p' keystroke to pause the display.

  Implemented the `h' keystroke to toggle the header.

  Implemented the `k' keystroke to kill a thread.

  Fixed various formatting bugs in not-so-rare cases.

  Added more specific error messages from DBI on connect failure.


VERSION 0.2:

  Added support for non-standard port numbers. But DBD::mysql seems to
  ignore it. Try and see if it works for you. Doesn't for me on two
  platforms.

  Fixed some spelling problems.

  Suggestions from "Richard Ellerbrock" <richarde@eskom.co.za>:

    * If no host is specified, assume localhost.

    * If no user is specified, assume root.

    * Allow C-c to break.

    * Better error handling and reporting on connect.

  Suggestions from "William R. Mattil" <wrm@newton.irngtx.tel.gte.com>:

    * Allow blank password, by setting initial default to ''.


VERSION 0.1:

  None. Initial release.
